# Code Review Guidelines

_Help the Code, Honor the Contributor_

## 1. Speak as a Peer, Not a Judge

Code reviews work best when they feel like shared problem-solving. Aim for a tone that invites collaboration rather than commands. Thoughtful language builds trust and makes people more willing to share their thinking — helping you catch misunderstandings early and work together toward better solutions.

**❌ Don’t:**
- “Why did you add this? The task doesn’t mention it.”
- “Why would you do it like this?”

**✅ Do:**
- “I didn’t see this in the task — curious what made you include it?”
- “This part looks a bit tricky — happy to pair if you’d like to walk through it together.”

## 2. Suggest a Fix or Share Helpful Resources — and Keep It Supportive

Pointing out issues is part of the process — but how we do it matters. Terse or dismissive comments can make people less eager to collaborate again.

**❌ Don’t:**
- “Use this function.”
- “You don’t need that constant.”

**✅ Do:**
- “This built-in function might simplify things — here’s a link to the docs.”
- “This could be hard to maintain — would splitting it into smaller functions help?”
